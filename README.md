This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expects a string argument but receives an array. The `greeter` function is designed to take a string and return a greeting. However, when an array is passed as an argument, TypeScript throws an error because the types don't match. The solution shows how to correctly handle this by either modifying the function to accept an array or changing the argument passed to the function.
